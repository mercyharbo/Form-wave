# Form wave project [ 50 projects 50 days course by Brad Traversy ]

This is a project from the 50 projects 50 days course by Brad Traversy and Florin that I was gifted by an amazing follower on Twitter sometime last year. In this project, I build a form that its label text letters animate one after the other on focus to enter the login email and password using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where I am able to learn something new.* I learned about things like:*

# What I learned 

- The split() method divides a String into an ordered list of substrings, puts these substrings into an array, and returns the array.  The division is done by searching for a pattern; where the pattern is provided as the first parameter in the method's call.

- The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

- The join() method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array (or an array-like object), separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the array has only one item, then that item will be returned without using the separator.

I also think I'm understanding CSS animation a little bit more, like how the transition works, transform property and I am hoping to do more in the coming days as I'm trying to grasp my knowledge around animation and graphics with CSS since I understand everything else so much already and know how to use them, so I can be able to rate my CSS 100/100 because right now I feel like I am just 80%/100.
